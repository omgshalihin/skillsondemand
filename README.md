## About the Project

Itâ€™s a skills on demand web app built in `Java` using `NextJs`. It allow users to `hire a professional for various types of services` such as a math teacher, a cook or even a developer. The goal of the project was basically to allow users to `locate professionals close to their area`, check the `details of the service` that the professional offers, proceed to `hire` and check their account details and `previous history`. This project uses a lot of technologies including `Azure`, `Vercel`, `MongoDB` and `Springboot`.
